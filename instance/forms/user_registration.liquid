      great idea. Defining built in validation as array seems to be semantic issue, as it does not make sense to add multiple errors for
      "presence" etc - using hash, as it's currently, seems ok to me. IIRC, the main idea was to allow developer to their own 
      validations - that's something we have recently added, we need to add documentation for it - the idea is quite similar.
