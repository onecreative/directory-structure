name: user_registration
resource: User
fields:
  first_name:
    label: First Name # maciek: the question is - is there a value of having to define label per form configuration? I would assume 
the main benefit of using this feature would be to define DRY up code, i.e. do not have to repeat label in all various forms which allow
user to edit first name. We have recently added possibility to add `metadata` to custom attributes, and it seems like a better place, because
it's globally attribute, not per form. Moreover, it will work only for one language; I think better way of handling labels, placeholders etc
would be to define metadata on custom attribute label to something like 'user.first_name' and then use `translations` feature to define the actual value
based on the current language. 

Another way to look at this feature is to allow to not only provide `metadata` on attribute level, but also at form level as well, in which scenario it would look more like
```
first_name:
  metadata:
    label: First Name
    custom_prop: Something 
```
I am just not seeing proper use case for it. There are two issues with metadata on custom attribute currently:
1. We don't inject it to `form_builder` currently - something we want and need to do
2. It will be possible only for custom attributes, not system fields - but the long term plan is to remove necessity of using system fields anyway

    - rule: not_empty
  last_name:
    label: Last Name
    validation:
    - rule: presence
      error: '{{form.fields.last_name.label}} must be provided'
  email:
    label: Email
  password:
    label: Password
  organization:
    label: Organization
    map: models/organization:name
    validation:
    - rule: presense
      error: '{{form.fields.organization.label}} must be provided'
