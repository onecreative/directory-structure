fields: # maciek: my intention was to rename `custom_attributes` to `fields` in custom_model_type.yml files etc, and then to
rename `properties` within configuration to `fields` as well. If we rename `configuration` to `fields` here, we would have
```
fields:
  first_name: 
  fields:
    custom_attr_1:
```
which would be quite confusing

  first_name:
    label: First Name
    validation:
    - rule: not_empty
  last_name:
    label: Last Name
    validation:
    - rule: presence
      error: '{{form.fields.last_name.label}} must be provided'
  email:
    label: Email
  password:
    label: Password
  organization:
    label: Organization
    map: models/organization:name
    validation:
    - rule: presense
      error: '{{form.fields.organization.label}} must be provided'
